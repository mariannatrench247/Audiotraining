# Audio Training - Text to Speech using Variational Autoencoders 

Text to Speech Models from data extracted from my data pipelines. The purpose of this project is to create a text to speech model with a GUI that allows users to copy&paste or drag files of text, which can then be converted into speech and downloaded for personal use. 

The model is developed using a variational encoder and supplies a variety of unique voices from Shakespearean to child like model. This project is intended for research purposes only and not commercial use.
